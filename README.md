# Wine Clustering Project (K-Means, PCA)

Back when I was doing a consulting project about import wines, the origin country and the types of wines are important indicators of the price and quality of wines. So, when I browse the numerous datasets available on Kaggle, I came across this dataset about wines that immediately caught my attention.

The wine dataset is donated by Stefan Aeberhard in 1991.

There are 178 observations. The dataset measures wines in 13 attributes/features, including Alcohol, Malic_Acid, Ash, Ash_Alcanity, Magnesium, Total_Phenols, Flavanoids, Nonflavanoid_Phenols, Proanthocyanins, Color_Intensity, Hue, OD280, and Proline. These attributes are collected through chemical analysis.

The grapes that are used to make the wines are grown in the same region in Italy but there are different types/cultivars among these grapes.
